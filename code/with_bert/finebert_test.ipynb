      "['Investors in Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the A options chain for the new August 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\\nThe put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $120.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of A, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.99/share today.\\nBecause the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 10% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 77%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.60% return on the cash commitment, or 5.45% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $125.00 strike is located relative to that history:\\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of A stock at the current price level of $138.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.75% if the stock gets called away at the August 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A\\'s trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:\\nConsidering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.83% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.83% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%.\\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today\\'s price of $138.99) to be 27%.

      " \"Fintel reports that on December 13, 2023, Wolfe Research initiated coverage of Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) with a Outperform recommendation.\\nAnalyst Price Forecast Suggests 1.04% Downside\\nAs of November 27, 2023, the average one-year price target for Agilent Technologies is 132.34. The forecasts range from a low of 101.00 to a high of $157.50. The average price target represents a decrease of 1.04% from its latest reported closing price of 133.74.\\nSee our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside.\\nThe projected annual revenue for Agilent Technologies is 7,130MM, an increase of 4.35%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 5.77.\\nAgilent Technologies Declares $0.24 Dividend\\nOn November 15, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share ($0.94 annualized). Shareholders of record as of January 2, 2024 will receive the payment on January 24, 2024. Previously, the company paid $0.22 per share.\\nAt the current share price of $133.74 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.71%.\\nLooking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.72%, the lowest has been 0.44%, and the highest has been 1.14%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.14 (n=235).\\nThe current dividend yield is 0.12 standard deviations below the historical average.\\nAdditionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.22. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.\\nThe company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.22%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.\\nWhat is the Fund Sentiment?\\nThere are 1945 funds or institutions reporting positions in Agilent Technologies.

      " 'In recent trading, shares of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $132.36, changing hands for $133.74/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.\\nThere are 14 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Agilent Technologies, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $100.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $146.00. The standard deviation is $12.779.\\nBut the whole reason to look at the average A price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with A crossing above that average target price of $132.36/share, investors in A have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $132.36 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

      " 'Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl,\\n Italy ’s oldest cooperative bank, may join Intesa Sanpaolo SpA\\nand Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA in selling new shares\\nthis year to boost capital.  The board of the Milan-based lender will meet today to\\nconsider a rights offer after the  Bank of Italy  sent a letter\\nasking it to reinforce its capital, two people familiar with the\\nsituation said April 14. Popolare Milano, which has to reimburse\\na 500 million-euro ($725 million) government bond by 2013,\\nrejected two weeks ago a proposal to sell new shares to boost\\nits  capital ratios , according to the people.  Bank of Italy Governor  Mario Draghi  in February urged the\\ncountry’s lenders to use profits to strengthen their reserves\\nand said he expects banks to raise money ahead of this year’s\\nstress test, which should be completed by June.  Popolare di Milano would be the fifth Italian lender to\\nannounce a capital increase. Banco Popolare SC concluded a 2\\nbillion-euro share sale in February, while Unione di Banche\\nItaliane SCPA in March asked investors to buy 1 billion euros of\\nnew shares. Intesa and Monte Paschi, the country’s No. 2 and No.\\n3 banks, have approved rights offer of 5 billion euros and 2\\nbillion euros respectively.  Basel Rules  “Rights issues are unavoidable for Italian banks to have\\nan adequate capital base to face new Basel rules,” said Angelo Manca, a portfolio manager at Ockham Capital Partners in  London .\\n“Recent decisions taken by banks traditionally seen as solid,\\nsuch as UBI and Intesa, confirm that.”  The Group of 20 nations last year endorsed rules proposed\\nby the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  that would triple\\nthe highest-quality capital that lenders need to hold. The\\ncommittee may also apply tougher rules to European banks\\nconsidered “systemically important financial institutions.”  UniCredit SpA, which raised 7 billion euros in the last\\nthree years through two capital increases, is the only bank\\namong Italy’s top five lenders that hasn’t asked for money from\\nits investors this year. Chief Executive Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  said April 2 that the capital of Italy’s biggest bank\\nis sufficient and its ratios already meet the Basel III\\nrequirements.

      " 'Gold extended gains to a record in\\n New York  as a drop in the dollar buoyed demand for the metal as\\nan alternative investment.  Futures surged yesterday after  Standard & Poor’s  revised\\nits U.S. credit outlook to negative. Gold has jumped 5.3 percent\\nthis year as the dollar dropped 4.8 percent against a basket of\\nsix other currencies including the euro and British pound.  Gold prices may keep rising for “some years into the\\nfuture,”  Blackrock Inc. (BLK)  fund manager  Evy Hambro  said in an\\ninterview with  Mark Barton  on Bloomberg TV’s “On the Move.”  Gold for June delivery rose $1.60, or 0.1 percent, to\\n$1,494.60 an ounce by 8:20 a.m. in New York after earlier today\\nclimbing to $1,498.90. Immediate-delivery gold was little\\nchanged at $1,493.93 an ounce in  London .  The 14-day relative strength index of gold futures rose to\\n70.135, above the level of 70 that some analysts who study\\ncharts view as a sign that prices are poised to drop.  “$1,500 is definitely a psychological level,” said Mark\\nO’Byrne, executive director of brokerage GoldCore Ltd. in\\nDublin. “Any correction is likely to be short and shallow,\\ngiven the very strong fundamentals.”  At current prices, gold is still $900 below the inflation-\\nadjusted level, GoldCore’s O’Byrne said, adding that gold may\\nreach as much as $2,400 in the coming years.  ‘Debt Issue’  “The focus has moved to the U.S. sovereign debt issue,”\\nO’Byrne said. “There are very significant risks in the world,\\nthat’s why people are diversifying into gold. Before, the  U.S.\\ngovernment debt  was meant to be risk free. Now that is in\\nquestion.”  Gold has gained in the last 10 years on increased\\ninvestment demand for commodities and on concern that currencies\\nmay be debased as central banks stimulate their economies.\\nUnrest in the Middle East, sovereign-debt turmoil in  Europe  and\\nJapan’s nuclear crisis have bolstered sales, propelling bullion\\n32 percent higher in the past year.  Additional support for gold came from quickening inflation\\nthat has prompted policy makers across the globe to raise\\n interest rates . Consumer prices in  China  rose at their quickest\\npace since 2008 in March, exceeding the government’s 2011 target\\nfor a third month.  Inflation ‘Impetus’  Inflation in the 17-nation euro region quickened to 2.7\\npercent from 2.4 percent in February, the European Union’s\\nstatistics office said last week. U.S. wholesale costs rose 5.8\\npercent in March compared with a year earlier, and the\\ngovernment said that the cost of living rose for a ninth month.  “Growing fears of rising inflation and a weak dollar\\ncontinue to benefit gold and silver,” Marc Ground, an analyst\\nat  Standard Bank , wrote in a note. “Inflation-hedge buying is\\nproviding the main impetus.”  Gold held in exchange-traded products rose 0.36 metric tons\\nto 2,070.32 tons yesterday, the highest level since Jan. 24,\\ndata compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show.  Silver for May delivery gained 0.7 percent to $43.275 an\\nounce. Palladium for June delivery was up 0.7 percent at $744.35\\nan ounce and platinum for July delivery rose 0.3 percent to\\n$1,788.70 an ounce.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.\"\n",
